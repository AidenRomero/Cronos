## Blender Projects

1. **Cubes**: I started off with a cube and formed it in to a rectangular prism and added the groves at the top to give it some definition. For the rectangular prism's animation all i did was make it traverse on the Y-Axis at different speeds. The light-emitting beams were made by making a texture with emission run from right to left while spinning on the X-Axis.

2. **Lights**: The Lights project that i created was a very simple but visually pleasing animation that i made using small circles on a grid with emission effect and a bit of camera tweaking. For the animation i made the pattern change by changing the properties of the grid making a very simple loop animation.

3.**HalloweenWeb**: This project was purposely made for halloween because at the time of creating it Halloween was just around the corner. The build was made with a variety of cylinders with a metallic material and the second cylinder was made with a larger amount of space of between the fractures in the cylinder and the material used was an orange emission material.
